THE CONTENT OF FILE WHEN CAN THIS HAPPEN?
ONE SITUATION THAT CAN CAUSE THIS TO HAPPEN
IS IF YOU'RE USING MODULES AND YOU MANUALLY
DELETE THE MODULE OUT DIRECTORY. FOR EXAMPLE,
IF I HAVE A MODULE NAMED "FOO", THERE SHOULD
BE A DIRECTORY NAMED FOO UNDER OUT/PRODUCTION.
IF YOU MANUALLY DELETE IT, THE BUILD SYSTEM MAY
NOT KNOW THAT IT NEEDS TO BE REBUILT.
