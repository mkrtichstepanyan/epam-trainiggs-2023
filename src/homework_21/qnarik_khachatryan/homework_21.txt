Implement a console application that will calculate the sorting velocity (speed) for the given array.
1. The application should accept two parameters: length of the array(from 0 to 1_000_000), and amount of attempts (from 0 to 10).
2. Generate an array of integers with the given length
3. Attempts (runs) for each sorting type should be in parallel.
4. The application should run sorting using four different algorithms (merge, quick, bubble, selection)
5. The result should be printed into console in the following way.

Array length - 1500, attempts (parallel runs) - 4
           | run 1 | run 2 | run 3 | run 4 | min | max | avg | median
bubble     |       |       |       |       |     |     |     |
selection  |       |       |       |       |     |     |     |
quick      |       |       |       |       |     |     |     |
merge      |       |       |       |       |     |     |     |
