An annotation based DTO validation mechanism needs to be developed.
Execution order
For Customer DTO
see the img.png file in the same directory

1. Need to create the following annotations:
Length - check that the length of the field matches the specified range (min, max)
Email - check that this field contains an email address. For validation
email addresses can use regex:
^[a-zA-Z0-9.!#$%&'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9](?:[a-zA-Z0-9-]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9])?(?:\.[a-zA-Z0-9](?:[a-zA-Z0-9-]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9])?)*$
Optional - Adulthood - checking that the client has reached the age of majority.
Min - check that the number is not less than the limit specified in the parameter.
Max - check that the number does not exceed the limit specified in the parameter
2. Create a Validator class with a single validate method that accepts as input dto and returns a list of errors found during the validation process. The class should work with any type of DTO.
3. When reading annotations from dto fields, it is necessary to validate each field depending on the annotation placed above it. In case of an error, add it to the resulting list
