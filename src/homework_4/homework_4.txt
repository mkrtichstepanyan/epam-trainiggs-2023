1. Create package with your <name_surname> in "src/homework_3" package (see example with my name in "scr/homework_4")
2. Crate package chapter_6 inside your package and write all book examples in Chapter 6
3. Create separate classes if there is need
4. Create brand new class with name Stack
    a. Implement simple stack that after initializing will have size 10, it should have two methods
        1)'push(int element)' that will add the given element onto a top of the stack
        2) 'pop()' that will return an element from the top of the stack
        in case push method is invoked, but the stack already full, print the following message in console: "The stack is already full!"
        in case pop method is invoked, but the stack is empty, print the following message in console and return null: "The stack is empty!"
    b. Overload a default constructor with one that will take as a parameter the size of the stack, so you the user can initialize a stack with the size they wants.
    c. Refactor the stack to accept as many elements as we want, when the stack is full by 75 percent, increase its size by two times (x2)
